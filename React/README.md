## JSX DEMO

- React takes empty HTML container and generates an UI
- React is loaded after initial HTML load
- Create first react app following -> https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html
- when exporting JSX element theme MUST be ONE root element (we can nest inside it as many as we wamt)

## VITE DEMO

- Installing Vite will allow us to use 'npm i react react-dom'
- it contains:
  - dev server
  - it is transpiler/compiler
  - bundler
  - (there is no need for babel or live server)
- installations

  - [x] npm i -D vite
  - [x] npm i react react-dom (after setting package.json)
  - [x] npm i -D @vitejs/plugin-react

- components - they are functions that return React elemens
- components always are written with CAPITAL letter
  - component a arrow funtion (const App = () => {})
  - component as function expression (const App = function (){})
  - component as function declaration (function App (){})
  - capital letters are important and they came from class components with React (not/rarely used)

## React DEMO
