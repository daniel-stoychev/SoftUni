#### Comments

- here we use 3 layer architecture (different than MVC)
  - standard for backend app development
  - three main elements (layer)
  - controller - group of actions handling the requests
  - service - handles & completes the requests (and the business logic / logical operation)
  - data - handles the data that is required by the service
