### Validation & Error handling

## Comments

- validation and error handling must be STABLE

# Validation

- keeps data in good shape
  - Example: user types user only and enteres without providing pass and logs in
- it can: success & allow OR reject
- no matter the data is being validated on client (due to UX (user experience)), it MUST be valided on the server as well
- we can validate on all three models -> controller, service, model

# Error handling
